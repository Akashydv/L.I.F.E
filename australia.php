										<h3>Permanent Resident Visa requirements of Australia:</h3>
										<p>As already said, Australia has a point-based immigration system. The process for obtaining Permanent Resident in Australia is a mix of online and offline activities. Let's first explore the key PR requirements of Australia</p>
										<h3>Organize Key Documents:</h3>
										<p>First, organize the key documents to request for PR in Australia. Apart from the routine travel and educational documents, you would need the two main documents, that is</p>
										<p>IELTS Result of the English proficiency test and<br>

Skill evaluation report by a relevant evaluating authority</p>
									<h3>Choose the Appropriate Visa:</h3>
									<p>You would require choosing the correct PR Visa category to apply. Australiaâ€™s common PR visa categories are Subclass 189 (Non-sponsored visa), Subclass 190 (State Nominated Visa), Subclass 186 (employer nominated visa), etc. See below all Australia PR Visa categories

</p>
									<h3>Select a SOL Occupation:</h3>
									<p>Once the relevant visa is chosen, you must select an occupation from the list of qualified occupations (SOL). If you apply for a non-sponsored visa (that is, a sub-class 189 visa), you must choose the SOL of Australia, while, if you are applying for a state-nominated visa (that is, a visa for subclass 190) , you must choose the combined list of eligible qualifying occupations & nbsp; of that particular Australian state.</p>
									<h3>Apply in Points Based System:</h3>
									<p>Once all the above things are done, it is time to apply in the points-based system of Australia. You must send the Expression of Interest (EOI) in Australia's Skill Select Online System, mentioning the key details of your profile, ie age, education, work experience, language ability, etc. You will be given points for each of your profile factors. Your overall score must be at least 65 points to apply through the system. However, a higher score will undoubtedly increase your chances of getting an invitation to apply for the visa.

</p>
									<h3>Health and Character Requirements:</h3>
									<p>You must meet the requirements of health and character, that is, must be medically fit and have a morally good character. You must also provide relevant certifications, after going through the medical examination and the character verification process.</p>
