							 What is Base Provincial Nomination?
							  </a>
							  </div>
							  <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
								<div class="card-body">
								 <p>Provinces and territories are also able to make nominations under their regular, or “base”, PNPs outside the Express Entry system. Individuals who wish to immigrate to Canada, but who are not eligible to enter the Express Entry pool, may still be able to make an application to immigrate to Canada through a base PNP, as long as they are eligible for the provincial program. Base nominations may therefore provide Canadian immigration opportunities to individuals who are not eligible for Express Entry.Candidates who receive a base nomination have their applications processed outside Express Entry. The route from a successful base nomination to permanent residence is a two-step process. Candidates must first satisfy the criteria for a PNP stream, apply, and receive a nomination certificate. With this certificate in hand, candidates may apply to the federal government for permanent resident status.</p>

							  </div>
							  <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
								<div class="card-body">
								  <p>If you got your ECA before 18th April, 2013, then probably you have not signed up for WES FSWP package in which they allow an electronic copy of your evaluation to be available for the CIO to verify it online. Even if you have signed up after they became a designated authority, you may have accidentally subscribed to “WES Basic” instead of “WES FSWP Package”. Just follow the email and get the payment done ASAP so that CIO can verify your ECA online.All the existing applicants are encouraged to login to there WES accounts and see Service level they have ordered, and upgrade to FSWP package BEFORE WES asks you to do so. If you do not order in time, your PER will be delayed or may jeopardize your chance of getting one.</p>

								<div class="card-body">
								  <p>After the application has been officially submitted, the entire process is expected to take up to 18 months. Obviously, there are many factors that affect the immigration application processing time, such as particular visa you are applying for, as well as which Canadian Immigration Visa Office is processing the application. Processing times can change at any time without any prior notice. On Jan1 2015, the Canadian government launched its new “Express Entry” Immigration System to speed up the process for applying for a PR Visa to Canada through certain “ Economic Immigration” programs, such as Federal Skilled Work Program (FSWP), Federal Skilled Trades Program(FSTP), Canadian Experience Class (CEC) Program. The Provincial Nominee Program(PNP) will also be affected by the new “ Express Entry” Canadian Immigration System.</p>

								</a>

							  <div id="collapseSeven" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
								<div class="card-body">
								  <p>As of Jan1 2015, Immigration to Canada through certain visa programs (such as Fedral Skilled Workers Program and Federal Skilled Trades Program ) issue “invitation only” under the new “Express Entry” system. Skilled foreign workers who submit an online “express entry “ profile with their relevant details and who appear to meet the requirements for certain economic immigration programs (e. g. FSWP, FSTP or CEC) may be placed into a “ Candidate Pool” for upto 12 months. In order to leave the candidate pool and receive an “ Invitation to Apply” (ITA) for a Permanent Resident Visa to Canada, a skilled foreign worker will need to receive a qualifying Canadian job offer or Nominated by a Province or territory in Canada (through PNP) or obtain a high enough score on the “Express Entry” Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) and they will also need to be highest ranked candidates in the pool when the ITAs are periodically issued throughout the year. Once the ITA is issued the skilled foreign worker will have 60 days to submit their complete Canadian PR Visa Application, all the documents and pay any necessary fee and should receive a decision on their visa application within 6 months. If all goes well, they will be issued a PR Visa to Canada and be approved for Canadian Immigration!</p>

								  <p>
No – Only applications for certain Canadian “economic immigration” programs (such as Federal Skilled Workers Program and Federal Skilled Trades Program and Canadian Experience Class Program) will be processed using the Express Entry System. In some cases under certain conditions, applications for the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) may also be processed through Express Entry System. Other Canadian immigration programs (such as the Family Sponsorship Program and Caregiver Program) will NOT be processed using the Express System and will continue to be processed as they have in the past.</p>

							  <div id="collapseTwelve" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
								<div class="card-body">
								  <p>Yes - depending on the particular Canadian immigration program. For example, the Federal Skilled Workers Program (FSWP) requires that you have at least 1 year of paid full-time (or the full-time equivalent), continuous work experience in an eligible occupation recognized by the Canadian government within the 10-year time period prior to applying for this Canadian immigration program. One of the requirements to apply for the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) is to have at least 2 years of continuous full-time paid work experience (or the full-time equivalent) in an eligible skilled trade during the five years prior to applying for this Canadian immigration program. Our legal team can evaluate your CV and other details to assess whether you meet the work experience and other requirements to apply for a Permanent Resident (PR) Visa to Canada through one of the various Canadian immigration programs.
